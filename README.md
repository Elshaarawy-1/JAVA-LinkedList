# Singly & Doubly Linked List and Polynomial Solver Implementation in Java

This repository contains the implementation of Singly & Doubly Linked List data structures and Polynomial Solver using Linked List data structure in Java.

## Singly Linked List

The Singly Linked List is a linear data structure in which each node points to the next node. It consists of a head node, which represents the first node of the list.

## Doubly Linked List

The Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure in which each node points to the next and the previous nodes. It consists of a head node, which represents the first node of the list.

## Polynomial SolverÂ 

This program reads up to 3 polynomials and performs addition, subtraction, evaluatingPolynomial, and multiplication on them. It uses the Linked List data structure to store the polynomials and perform the operations.
